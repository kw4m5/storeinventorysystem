This project was developed for our Spring 10 Database Programming class, and was hosted on google code, so we can share it with everybody. We developed it using .NET C#, Access database and crystal reports. For the front end we mainly used winforms. Our project also has a adminstrative perspective where an admisntrator can give right access to different users to the database. We store information about products, items, employees, customers, orders, and details. Then we use the orders and order details to create a transaction which is what is basically displayed in the report.
